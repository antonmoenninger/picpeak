### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin? You can start by looking through these issues:

* [Good first issues](https://github.com/PicPeak/picpeak/labels/good%20first%20issue) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/PicPeak/picpeak/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which need extra attention

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repo** and create your branch from `main` (active development)
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and ensure:
   - Code follows the existing style
   - Tests pass: `npm test`
   - Linting passes: `npm run lint`
4. **Write tests** if you've added code
5. **Update documentation** if needed
6. **Attach a screenshot for any UI change** (see below)
7. **Create a Pull Request**

> **📸 Screenshots are required for UI changes.** Any PR that changes a user-facing surface — a component, page, layout, style, or in-app copy — must include at least one screenshot of the result in the PR description, showing before/after where it helps reviewers see the difference. PRs that touch the UI without a screenshot will be asked to add one before review. Backend-only or otherwise non-visual changes don't need one.

#### Where screenshots live

- **Contributors working from a fork:** drag the image into the PR description or a comment. GitHub hosts it for you; there is nothing to push.
- **Maintainers and anyone pushing to this repository:** commit screenshots to the `pr-assets` branch, never to a branch of their own. `pr-assets` is an orphan branch that holds only images, one folder per PR or issue:

  ```
  screenshots/<issue-or-pr>-<n>/<file>.png     # e.g. screenshots/1446-2/sign-step-dark.png
  issue-assets/<topic>/<file>.png              # images for issue reports
  ```

  Link them through `raw.githubusercontent.com`:

  ```markdown
  <img width="420" alt="Sign step, dark" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PicPeak/picpeak/pr-assets/screenshots/1446-2/sign-step-dark.png" />
  ```

  To add images, check the branch out in a separate worktree so your working branch stays untouched:

  ```bash
  git fetch origin pr-assets
  git worktree add ../picpeak-pr-assets pr-assets
  mkdir -p ../picpeak-pr-assets/screenshots/1446-2
  cp ~/Desktop/sign-step-*.png ../picpeak-pr-assets/screenshots/1446-2/
  git -C ../picpeak-pr-assets add screenshots/1446-2
  git -C ../picpeak-pr-assets commit -m "chore: screenshots for 1446"
  git -C ../picpeak-pr-assets push origin pr-assets
  ```

  Rules for `pr-assets`:
  - Never delete it or force-push it. Every older PR and issue loads its images from it.
  - Don't overwrite an existing file. Add a new name, such as `-v2.png`, because the raw CDN can keep serving the old image for a while.
  - Images only (PNG/JPEG/WebP/GIF, short MP4/WebM). No code, no secrets, and nothing that shows real customer data.
  - Don't create new `screenshots/*` branches; the old ones were folded into `pr-assets`.

## 💻 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.12.0 or later (matches `backend/package.json`)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/picpeak.git
cd picpeak

# Install dependencies
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ..

# Start Postgres and Redis (the app itself runs on the host, see below)
docker compose up -d postgres redis

# Backend config — note this is backend/.env, not the root one
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# JWT_SECRET must be set: the host process validates it and exits without one.
# (The containers generate it themselves; `npm run dev` does not.)

# Backend, with nodemon hot reload — http://localhost:3001
cd backend && npm run dev

# Frontend, with Vite hot reload, in a second shell — http://localhost:5173
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**. Vite proxies `/api` to the backend on `3001`, so
you do not need the root `.env` for this loop at all — that one configures the
compose stack.

Running the two Node processes on the host is the fastest loop: both reload on save, and you get a real debugger and stack traces without rebuilding an image.

**Prefer everything in containers?** `docker compose up -d` builds `backend`, `frontend` and `ml` from source using the production Dockerfiles. That works, but there is no hot reload — you rebuild on every change (`docker compose up -d --build backend`).

> `docker-compose.dev.yml` is listed in `.gitignore` and is not part of the repo. If you keep a local one for live-mounting `./backend/src` and `./frontend/src` against `backend/Dockerfile.dev` / `frontend/Dockerfile.dev`, remember it bakes `node_modules` into the image: after pulling a change to `backend/package.json`, rebuild that image or you will get a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` restart loop.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend && npm test

# Frontend tests
cd frontend && npm test

# E2E tests (needs Docker; see below)
scripts/e2e.sh
```

#### E2E suite

`scripts/e2e.sh` runs the Playwright suite in `tests/e2e` against its own stack, `docker-compose.e2e.yml`. That stack uses compose project `picpeak-e2e` and ports 7200–7225, so it does not touch a dev stack you already have running. The script:

1. builds the images from your checkout and starts the stack on an empty database
2. waits for every service to be healthy
3. seeds a known state: admin `admin@example.com` with a password generated for this run (saved with the other generated credentials in `.e2e/credentials.env`), no forced password change, auth rate limit raised, OIDC off
4. runs Playwright, passing along any arguments you give it
5. tears the stack down again

```bash
npx playwright install chromium                     # once
scripts/e2e.sh                                      # every spec, both projects
scripts/e2e.sh --project=chromium --grep @smoke     # the subset CI runs on PRs
E2E_KEEP_STACK=1 scripts/e2e.sh tests/e2e/seo-settings.spec.ts   # keep the stack up afterwards
E2E_NO_BUILD=1 scripts/e2e.sh                       # reuse the images from the last run
```

With the stack kept up you can also run `npx playwright test` on its own after loading the run's credentials: `set -a; . .e2e/credentials.env; set +a`. On failure, traces are in `test-results/` (`npx playwright show-trace <trace.zip>`) and the backend log is saved to `test-results/e2e-backend.log`.

When writing a spec:

- create the data it needs through the API, and don't depend on what other specs leave behind
- restore any global setting it changes in a `finally` block or an `afterEach`, so a failed assertion doesn't leak into later specs
- log in through `tests/e2e/_helpers/admin.ts`, and prefer role + exact name or `data-testid` locators over label regexes, which start matching a second element as soon as the UI grows one
- tag it `@smoke` in the test title if it is fast and covers a core flow

CI runs the `@smoke` subset on every pull request, and every spec on both projects nightly (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).

## 📝 Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * 🎨 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * 🐛 `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * 🔥 `:fire:` when removing code or files
  * 📝 `:memo:` when writing docs
  * 🚀 `:rocket:` when improving performance
  * ✨ `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature

### JavaScript/TypeScript Styleguide

* Use ES6+ features
* Prefer async/await over promises
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add JSDoc comments for functions
* Follow ESLint rules

### React Styleguide

* Use functional components with hooks
* Keep components small and focused
* Use TypeScript for type safety
* Follow the existing folder structure
* Write tests for new components
* Settings forms save through the shared `SettingsSaveBar` (`frontend/src/components/admin/SettingsSaveBar.tsx`): keep a snapshot of what the server sent, derive `isDirty` by comparing the draft to it, and render the bar as the last child of the page. No per-card Save buttons; instant-save switches stay instant.

### Styling

* Admin code styles through the UI tokens: `bg-panel`, `text-body`, `border-line`, ... (see `frontend/STYLING.md`). No `dark:` neutral pairs — the lint rule refuses them, `npm run codemod:ui-tokens` rewrites them.
* Never read a theme token (`var(--color-*)`, `bg-surface`, `text-theme`) in admin code; those belong to the operator-themed gallery and portal.
* A new shade is a new token in `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`, not a raw palette class in a component.

## 🌿 Branch model

PicPeak runs on two long-lived branches:

| Branch | Role | What targets it |
|---|---|---|
| **`main`** | Active development. The next release is being assembled here. | Feature PRs. Most bugfix PRs. |
| **`stable`** | Curated release channel. Production-recommended. | Security fixes and regular bugfix backports, kept small and free of unrelated features. |

A third branch, `pr-assets`, only hosts PR and issue screenshots. It never holds code, and no PR targets it (see [Where screenshots live](#where-screenshots-live)).

### Which branch should my PR target?

- **New feature** → target `main`.
- **Bugfix that ONLY affects active dev** → target `main`.
- **Bugfix that current stable users need** → target `main`; regular bug fixes are generally backported automatically to `stable`. Maintainers handle conflicts or create a separate focused backport PR when needed.
- **Security vulnerability** → report privately using [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Security fixes are always released on both `stable` and `main`; coordinate any fix with the maintainers before opening a public PR.

**Hard rule on PR scope**: bugfix PRs against `stable` must be small enough to backport without conflict. Omnibus PRs (e.g. five unrelated sub-features) are fine for `main`, but never for `stable` — they make the next `main → stable` merge painful and break the "stable is always shippable" invariant.

If you're not sure which branch to target, default to `main` and a maintainer will retarget during review.

## 🔄 Release Process

Releases are cut independently from `main` (pre-release versions for the active channel) and `stable` (semver releases for the curated channel). `release-please` handles version bumps, changelog generation, and Docker image publication automatically — contributors don't update `package.json` or `CHANGELOG.md` by hand.

Periodic `main → stable` merges promote a batch of `main` work to the stable channel. The maintainer chooses when (typically every ~4 weeks, sooner if a hot bug demands it).

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the full operational doc (promotion criteria, conflict-resolution checklist for the `main → stable` merge, hotfix backport path, versioning rules).
