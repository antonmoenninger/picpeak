 * Download renditions (#858).
 *
 * One place that answers "what bytes does this photo ship as for this
 * download?" — used by the single-photo route, the selected-photos archive,
 * the cached download-all build, and the custom-resolution job builder.
 *
 * The ordering matters and is the whole reason this is centralised: the
 * watermark is sized relative to its input's width, so it MUST be applied
 * after the resize. Watermarking the original and then downscaling would
 * resample the mark and burn CPU on pixels that get thrown away.
 *
 * Returns null when the photo needs no transformation at all, which lets
 * callers stream the original straight from storage instead of buffering it.
